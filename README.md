Sigilith v2.1 — Symbolic Decoding Framework

Sigilith is a modular, non-interpretive framework for decoding symbolic structures across mythographic, dream-logic, quantum, synesthetic, and temporal glyph systems.

This version (v2.1) represents the pure symbolic edition, with all signal-processing and interpretive modules removed. Sigilith operates exclusively on structure — not meaning — and applies a universal decoding pipeline to any discrete symbolic input.
